# Space-Invaders
A game made using the pygame library. 
Consists of a spaceship which can shoot bullets to hit the enemies which keep on appearing from the top of the screen and a score counter which increments each time an enemy is hit.
The game is over when an enemy reaches close enough to the spaceship.
